Ethical Design - 
Design with the intent to do good
What's the impact of what you're building?
Surveillance Capitalism
If your only monetization is selling users and their data then problems will follow you around
Dark Patterns
Giving people choices in such a way that make people do something they do not want to do
Stress triggers/pressure triggers
Human centered Design
Is what we are doing good for users or just for conversion rates?
Only collect data when you really need it
what are you willing to give up to give people the good to make us happy
It's not ok to build unethically
DEsign with the intent to do better

Javascript Diversity -
Javascript ecosystem
Interesting SegmentFault vs Stackoverflow
English centric stackoverflow and differences for the rest of the world.
Angular/cli increasing as of late
convergent evolution

12 Factor Apps by dockerization -
    declarative formats for setup automation
    clean contract with the OS
    minimize divergence between dev and prod
    Scale up without significant changes
Dockerfile > Image > Container
Docker Engine - intermediate layer between the container and OS
Using env files similar to our conf.properties files, docker can make dev/prod parity
disposability
12factor.net

404 Fire Alarm Not Found -
Intent of the user
Emergency cord is only for when the train will cause bodily harm to someone
Bad design is everywhere

Tamagotchi - 
Generators
    yield keyword
    generator.next() => step through
    yield*
    returning in a generator cancels the generator
    generator.return() => cancels the generator
Coroutines
    cooperatively passes control between two routines
    you can yield all sorts of things, promises etc.
co module

TensorFlow for Javascript -
Inbrowser Machine learning
layers API
    Keras
Core API
    Mathemicals of Machine Learning
Out of the box
    training models in browser or node
    pretrained models
    retrain models
Speech recognition
tfjs-vis
    the visor
    available in the docs
convolution layers run filters over an image and make decisions based on output

After Lunch

Internationalisation-
I18n, letter between the two ends
internationalization is about accessibility
language, writing system, writing directions, pluralization, etc.
    react intl
    ecmascript international api
        format.JS
    unicode
    always let the user choose their locale
    common locale data repository
    Internation components for unicode
        icu message format
    It's so much easier to bake into things early


Being a good ally-
    the tyranny of structurelessness
        not having structure makes it easier to maintain the status quo
        spread out power
        rotate roles
        spread of information
        access to resources
    stop calling people talented - people worked their asses off to gain expertise
    screw civility forget fairness, consider power
        you can become the problem by voicing the problem
        work hard and people won't notice
        underestimated, ignored and stymied
        enforce inclusion instead of civility
        Have a little more leeway
    Assume it's you
        When you are on the upward side it's on you to level the field
    Spend your social capital

How does Javascript Math
coercion - implicitly converting a value of one type to another
    adding a number and a string converts the number to a string and concatenates
    adding arrays
    if either a or b is a string or its primitive default value is a string
    + casts anything to a number
    {} is ambiguous
experiment/guess/research


Microservices - 
assumption: microservices are only for companies the size of google facebook or amazon
not true
software is easy to write hard to change
coupling is the enemy of change
make the monolith the choice that has to justify itself
problem with microservices is lack of familiarity
one location where many concerns are colocated
what is a service
    autonomy
    they aren't asked and do not ask for anything
how do services do anything
    store the sequence of events
The pieces of a microservice based system
    services
    Application
    users
    message bus
    read models
    Aggregators - shape models

Keyboard accessibility
if an application is not keyboard it will impact the largest number of users
mouse only interaction
focus indicator
navigation is non intuitive
tab navigation insufficient
event.preventDefault - very powerful can break a lot of things
    never trap tab press
semantic html - use the tags for what you want
tabindex=0 allows a keyboard to reach non standard
WAI-ARIA
role, state, and property
guided focus management
    managing modals
